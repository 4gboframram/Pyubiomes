# Pyubiomes, a Simple (wip) Python Wrapper For [Cubiomes by Cubitect](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes)
## Introduction
Pyubiomes is a (relatively) easy to use, easy to understand wrapper for the Cubiomes C library and a few more libraries. This project is still a wip, so please mention bugs/improvements. 

If you have any problems, look at the documentation, then ask on the discord server. Do not make a new issue. I will likely not see it.

This module requires [minecraft_nether_gen_rs](https://github.com/SeedFinding/minecraft_nether_generation_rs)'s Python binding for the nether utilities 

This project's [code documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) can be found on 
its [github repository](https://github.com/4gboframram/Pyubiomes)
